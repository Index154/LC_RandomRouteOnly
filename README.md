# RandomRouteOnly
https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Index154/RandomRouteOnly/

A simple mod to make your runs more interesting by making your ship travel to a random moon every day (unless there are 0 quota days remaining). Every player in the lobby can use the random command in the terminal to reroll the moon only once per quota! Routing to a specific moon is entirely disabled.

Requires routerandom.
